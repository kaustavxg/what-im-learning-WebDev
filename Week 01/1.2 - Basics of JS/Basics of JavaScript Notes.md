## What are filters?
# The filter method in JavaScript is designed as a higher-order function that iterates over each element of an array, allowing developers to apply a specific condition to filter out elements.

 # The filter method doesn't modify the original array, but instead creates and returns a new array containing only the elements that meet the specified condition.
